Moodle Differentiator
=========================
[![Moodle Plugin CI](https://github.com/lucaboesch/moodle-local_differentiator/workflows/Moodle%20Plugin%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/lucaboesch/moodle-local_differentiator/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Moodle+Plugin+CI%22+branch%3Amaster)

A tool to efficiently formulate and save learning goals.
This plugin is based off The Differentiator by Ian Byrd <http://byrdseed.com/differentiator/>.

Install under local/differentiator. There is no navigation node created.
You have got to direct your users to that address otherwise, eg. by a link
in the footer or in a custom menu.

Note that this ships with a differentiator_user_tour.json file which you can
import into Site administration → Appearance → User tours.
Multi-language content filter has to be enabled for the site to display the
user tour correctly – alternatively you can edit it to preserve just one
language.
