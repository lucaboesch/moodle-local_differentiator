# Moodle Differentiator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lucaboesch/moodle-local_differentiator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lucaboesch/moodle-local_differentiator) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lucaboesch/moodle-local_differentiator/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lucaboesch/moodle-local_differentiator?branch=master)
A tool to efficiently formulate and save learning goals.
This plugin is based off The Differentiator by Ian Byrd <http://byrdseed.com/differentiator/>.

Install under local/differentiator. There is no navigation node created.
You have got to direct your users to that address otherwise, eg. by a link
in the footer or in a custom menu.

Note that this ships with a differentiator_user_tour.json file which you can
import into Site administration → Appearance → User tours.
Multi-language content filter has to be enabled for the site to display the
user tour correctly – alternatively you can edit it to preserve just one
language.
